## Getting Started

1.	Home page provides a button to pull data from API and store this into persistence PostGres Database. 
a.	Future update to this is planned to have user authentication so that only authenticated users can perform API calls. 
2.	Search page allows users to search the database for specific recipes. Just fill in fields relating to the specific search criteria and click search. 
Example: If you want to only find recipes with olives then in the ingredient filed type in the word “olive” and click search. This will only return recipes that require olives.
